# Expo starter guide

## Installation

### Prerequisites
* Node.js (at least v14)
* Expo go app on the phone (optional, for previewing the app in real time on the device)

Similar to lots of Web dev frameworks, command `npx create-expo-app@latest` creates a project directory of a new expo project.

## Base workflow
The expo workflow is relatively simple
