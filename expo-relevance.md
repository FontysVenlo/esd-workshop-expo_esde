# 1) Why is Expo (still) relevant?

**Short answer:** Expo remains highly relevant because it *dramatically lowers friction* for building, testing and shipping React Native apps while offering a growing escape hatch to native when needed. That combination (fast productivity + extensibility) keeps it a popular, practical choice for many teams in 2024–2025. ([Expo Documentation][1])

**Key reasons:**

* **Integrated build & CI/CD services (EAS):** Expo’s EAS Build / EAS Workflows provide hosted, automated builds, signing and app-store submission integrations — so teams don’t need to run macOS build machines or craft complex native pipelines themselves. This reduces DevOps friction for distribution. ([Expo Documentation][1])

* **Modern, productive developer experience:** Expo’s managed workflow, Expo Go, development builds, and the dev-client model let developers iterate quickly on a single JS/TS codebase with live reloading, OTA updates, and consistent APIs for common mobile functionality (camera, sensors, notifications, updates). These features speed prototyping and small-to-medium product development. ([Expo][2])

* **Over-the-air updates and app-update tooling:** Expo supports smooth push/OTA updates (expo-updates) which can reduce iteration cycles and allow fast fixes without full app store submissions. That’s a concrete productivity win in production. ([Expo Documentation][1])

* **Lowered barrier for teams already using React / web tech:** Because Expo sits on top of React Native and uses JS/TS, teams with React experience can often be productive immediately — useful for startups, cross-functional teams and web-first shops. Several 2024–2025 writeups and community answers echo this point. ([Medium][3])

* **Growing flexibility (escape hatches):** Historically a criticism of Expo was “you’re locked out of native.” That’s changed: Expo now provides **custom development clients**, the **Expo Modules API**, and clearer managed → bare workflows so teams can add native modules or custom code without abandoning the Expo toolchain entirely. This reduces the trade-off between convenience and native access. ([Medium][4])

**Bottom line:** Expo is relevant because it accelerates mobile development while offering clear paths to add native capabilities if/when required — a pragmatic balance that suits many modern app teams. ([Expo Documentation][1])
