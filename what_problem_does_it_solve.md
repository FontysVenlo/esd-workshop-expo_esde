# What problems does Expo solve?

## Bridging / erasing the gap between web and mobile dev
Traditionally, building mobile apps requires knowledge in Swift / Kotlin / Obj-C / Java, as well as using Xcode / Android Studio, which contains a learning curve. Addidionally, when creating apps for both platofrms, two separate codebases exist, which need managing and maintaining. Expo offers a way to build apps for both platforms (+ the web) with a single, JS / TS based codebase. Also, being built on top of the React Native, it makes it easy for web developers to adopt it in building native apps.

## Infrastructure provision
Expo provides a lot of infrastructure for development, deployment and build management. For example, Expo provides Expo Go, which can load and preview the app in real time, increasing development speed. Moreover, it provides the services to build apps on cloud, which is specifically useful for building IOS apps while developing on devices that do not run MacOS. Additionally, it provides infrastructure for managing updates, granting ability to provide updates over-the-air (OTA), meaning that users do not have to update the app through the native app stores.

## SDK unification
For many native app's use cases / features expo provides a unified APIs - for camera, audio, notifications, sensors, etc. It helps to centralize and unify all these different functionalities and it comes with them built-in, so developers can use them instantly.
